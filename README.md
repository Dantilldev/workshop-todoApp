# Todolist App

# Description:
This project is part of an assignment from our course, where we practiced using state and callback functions in React. The app is a simple todolist that allows users to add, update, and delete tasks.
# Functionality:
- Add Task: Users can enter a task in the input field and click "Add" to add it to the list.
  - Mark as Done: Each task has a button that allows the user to mark it as done or not done.
    - Delete Task: Each task has a delete button that allows the user to remove it from the list.
- Delete All Tasks: There is a button that allows the user to delete all tasks at once.
-  localStorage: The app saves and restores tasks from localStorage, ensuring that tasks persist even after the page is refreshed.
   # Technologies Used:
    - React: Library for building user interfaces.
      - Tailwind: CSS framework for styling.
        - Vite: Build tool for faster development.
          - localStorage: Saves data locally to retain the list even after page reloads.
